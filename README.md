# The AMPL solver for bin packing problem

> [!NOTE]
> The **bin packing problem** can be informally defined in a very simple way. We are given $N$ **items** each having an integer weight $w_j$ for $j = 1..N$, and an unlimited number of identical **bins** of integer **capacity** $C$. The objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of bins so that the total weight packed in any bin does not exceed the capacity. We assume, with no loss of generality, that $0 < w_j < C$ for all $j$ for $j = 1..N$.
